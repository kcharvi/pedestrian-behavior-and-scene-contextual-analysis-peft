# Adaptive System Design Recommendations

Evidence-based recommendations for intelligent pedestrian monitoring system.

## Performance Summary

- **Average processing time**: 80.22 ms
- **95th percentile**: 105.47 ms
- **Adapter-YOLO agreement**: 0.538 (53.8%)

## Hypothesis Validation

### H1: Low Density Individual Analysis
- **Low density frames**: 18.5% of dataset
- **Confidence in low density**: 0.915
- ** Recommendation**: Always trigger detailed analysis for sparse scenes

### H2: Nighttime Enhanced Monitoring
- **Night confidence**: 0.832 vs **Day confidence**: 0.869
- **Night processing**: 61.1ms vs **Day processing**: 80.4ms
- ** Recommendation**: Increase monitoring frequency during nighttime

### H3: Weather Impact Analysis
- **Cloudy**: 83.11ms processing, 0.870 confidence
- **Rainy**: 76.07ms processing, 0.850 confidence
- **Snowy**: 59.54ms processing, 0.940 confidence
- **Sunny**: 83.28ms processing, 0.870 confidence
- ** Recommendation**: Adjust detection sensitivity based on weather conditions

### H4: Road Width Impact
- **Narrow Road**: Typical density: high_pedestrian_density, 83.3ms processing
- **Wide Road**: Typical density: low_pedestrian_density, 65.1ms processing
- ** Recommendation**: Adapt crossing time estimates based on road geometry

## Adaptive Triggering Strategy

Based on analysis results, implement the following decision tree:

### Priority Level 1 (Always Trigger)
- Nighttime conditions (visibility reduced)
- Low pedestrian density (â‰¤3 pedestrians)
- Adverse weather (rainy, snowy, foggy)
### Priority Level 2 (Selective Triggering)
- Medium pedestrian density (4-7 pedestrians)
- Cloudy weather conditions
- Wide road with high activity

### Priority Level 3 (Optimized Triggering)
- High pedestrian density (>7 pedestrians)
- Sunny daytime conditions
- Stable environmental conditions

## Resource Allocation Strategy

### Computational Efficiency
- **Adapter processing**: 35.10ms average
- **YOLO processing**: 10.91ms average
- **Speed advantage**: 0.31x (YOLO faster)

### Recommended Architecture
1. **Primary Detection**: YOLO for rapid pedestrian counting
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Adapters for detailed behavior prediction
3. **Context Awareness**: Scene adapters for environmental understanding
4. **Adaptive Pipeline**: Dynamic triggering based on scenario complexity
